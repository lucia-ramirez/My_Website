Hi! My name is Lucia Ramirez Navarro. I recently graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences](https://www.lcg.unam.mx/) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and I am currently doing the MPhil in Biological Science (Sanger Institute) with [Dr Gosia Trynka](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-faculty/). Previously, I was working with [Dr. Alejandra Medina Rivera](https://liigh.unam.mx/profile/dra-alejandra-medina-rivera/) to characterize regulatory variants in promoters with enhancer activity and their relation with human diseases.
